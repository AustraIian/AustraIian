## Introduction
Greetings! I am Barcode (or better known as lllIIIIIIllII), a dedicated competitive player in the realm of Battlefield 2042, proudly affiliated with Team Synergy. My expertise lies mainly in infantry and strictly ground vehicle combat (LAV, MBT, ETC), contributing to the team's history, playstyle and tournament history 



### Team Synergy
Team Synergy was created by a Professional Battlefield Player in the Battlefield 4 Era called EneXq. it was a fallback team for personal tournaments that were held in the OCE Region of Battlefield. we have participated in a multitude of tournaments and have won several thanks to EneXq, who are amazing in the OCE Community.




### My Journey
My journey in Battlefield began with the release of Bad Company 1, this got me into PC Gaming and enthusiast building, and led me to get good with any Games up the alley of First Person Shooters!
